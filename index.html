				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/"><u>Department of Computer
							Science</u></a> and <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/certificate/iqbiology/"><u>IQ
							Biology</u></a> at the University of Colorado Boulder. I
					work at the intersection of computing and biology with a focus on software for genomics and
					bioinformatics. I am interested in developing tools to help biologists and clinicians analyze and
					interpret large-scale biological data.

					<h2>Current Work</h2>
					<section id="layer-lab">
						<h3>The Layer Lab <a class="link" href="https://ryanlayerlab.github.io/layerlab/"
								target="_blank">â†—</a></h3>
						<p>
							In <a href="https://github.com/ryanlayer"><u>Ryan Layer</u></a>'s lab, I am working to make population-scale genomics more accessible by leveraging modern sequencing technologies and emerging data structures.
						</p>
					<h2>Previous Labs & Work</h2>
					<section id="chuong-lab">
						<h3>The Chuong Lab <a class="link" href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/chuong/"
								target="_blank">â†—</a></h3>
						<p>
							I am currently rotating in the Chuong Lab, where I will be using long-read sequencing to
							investigate the genomes of honey bees, extending my work in the Layer Lab beyond humans.

					<section id="olm-lab">
						<h3>The Olm Lab <a class="link" href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/olm/" target="_blank">â†—</a>
						</h3>
						<p>
							With <a href="https://github.com/MrOlm/"><u>Matt Olm</u></a>'s guidance, I developed <a
								href="https://github.com/Bennibraun/bifidotyper"><u>Bifidotyper</u></a>, a small
							bioinformatics tool to help researchers investigate Bifidobacteria in stool sequencing
							samples.

					</section>

					<section id="layer-lab">
						<h3>The Layer Lab <a class="link" href="https://ryanlayerlab.github.io/layerlab/"
								target="_blank">â†—</a></h3>
						<p>
							In <a href="https://github.com/ryanlayer"><u>Ryan Layer</u></a>'s lab, I experimented with
							genome assemblies from long-read sequencing data, demonstrating the potential for
							reference-free structural variant analyses.

						<h3>The Tothova Lab <a class="link" href="https://tothovalab.dana-farber.org/"

						<p>
							I served as the Associate Computational Biologist in Zuzana Tothova's lab at the <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana%E2%80%93Farber_Cancer_Institute"><u>Dana-Farber
									Cancer Institute</u></a> for 2 years. During this time, I handled a wide variety of
							functional sequencing projects investigating <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesin"><u>cohesin</u></a> mutations in cancer.
							Several publications related to this work are available:

				<h2>Outside the Lab</h2>
				<p>
					When I'm not crashing supercomputers or generating bugs, you can find me working on problems at the bouldering gym, hiking in the Rockies, or getting lost in a really good book.

					If you're outdoorsy, add me on Strava: <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/167705600" class="inline-logo-link" target="_blank" aria-label="Strava">
